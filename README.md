# Face Recognition Based Attendance System

This simple desktop application will allow you to compare faces with given photos and record their attendance in the MySQL database. Though it is not the best approach to accomplish this task, it was just a practice project to learn the OpenCV library.

**Platform:** Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Technologies:** `Python`, `Tkinter`, `OpenCV`, `MySQL`

**Features:**
- This app tries to capture continuous shots through the camera until it finds a matching face.
- It matches your face with the given photo samples.
- If it matches, the app records your attendance instantly.

*Database file is missing :( (sorry)
